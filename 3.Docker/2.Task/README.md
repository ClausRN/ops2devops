# Docker-Compose

Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

## docker-compose.yml

- Open `docker-compose.yml` and examine the content of the file. 
- Note :
    - Internal name
    - Container name
    - Build
    - Ports
    - Volumes

- run `docker-compose up` to build and run the container.
- open a browser to `http://studentip:80` and see the website, is back to scratch, from before you did your edit in the earlier task.
- Press `ctrl+c`to cancel the running container.


- Make changes to the `html/index.html` file. Change it to something, other than wat you did before, to be able to see it's new changes.
- run `docker-compose up -d` to run the container as a service
- run `docker ps` and see the container running.
- Note the name if the container, is nginx
- open a browser to `http://studentip:80` and see the new changes to the website.
- Note the changes is not build into the container, but instead directly presented from the html directory.
